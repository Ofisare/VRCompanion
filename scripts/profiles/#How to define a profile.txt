Users should create their own profiles in the user_profiles folder.
Those will not be overriden by an update.
If you create a profile with the same name as an official, your own profile will be loaded instead.
So feel free to copy a profile and modify it to your liking.

There is a more thorough how to in the user_profiles folder with all available gestures, actions etc.
